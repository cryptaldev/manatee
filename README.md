> Unlock power of Ocean Protocol within your Slack workspace

[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeybmevV2nw)

### Usage 

1. install dependencies
`npm i`

1. start the server
`npm start`

> Note - to use this local server instance in your app (for testing) without hosting it via https connection. You might need to tunnel it to remote server using something like [Ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok)

> Note - Publishing into Ocean is done using [Ocean Protocol's Agent](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/agent) and Search is done directly using [Aquarius' search API](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius). So, if either of these 2 components are done then it might affect the functioning of this app
